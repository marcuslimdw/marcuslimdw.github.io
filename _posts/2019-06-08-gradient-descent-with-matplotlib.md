There are a thousand and one gradient descent tutorials on the Internet, so I'm sure everyone knows how to do manual gradient descent by now. Instead of going through it, I'm just going to put up a animation that might help visualise the process:

The code to produce the animation is available [here]({{ page.asset_path }}gradient-descent.ipynb). I didn't leave any comments because I didn't think I'd be sharing it publicly, but times change. It should be pretty self-explanatory, though!
