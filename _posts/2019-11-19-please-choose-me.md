Please choose me.

I just applied for the Google and FB AI residencies. This is probably the closest I will ever get to a personal blog post here, after having been apparently inactive for a long time. (They don't accept cover letters)

To be honest, I have something like 6 mostly written post drafts just inactive. Partially because I rewrite them every once in a while because I think they're not good enough. Partially because sometimes I have too many things on my mind. Partially because I lack motivation.

But mostly because I think nobody will actually see them.

Anyway, on the off chance that you're a recruiter/technical interviewer from one of the AI residencies, this is why you should choose me:

* I learn quickly. I started with Python in May last year. I was active on Stack Overflow, mostly answering Python questions, from February to June (5 months). In that period, I reached top 10 in yearly reputation. That shows that I became good enough at both programming and communication to answer complex questions very, very quickly.

* I'm curious. I picked up regular expressions, data structures, functional programming, `keras`, geospatial libraries, Django, `flask` and all sorts of other little things by myself.

* I really, really believe in the power of deep learning. I'm not sure how I can show this other than by saying it.

* I have great reviews from Codementor and became a featured mentor my second week in. I do a fair bit of deep learning work, so I actually have experience building kind-of-but-not-really production code.

* My talent is being wasted here. Nobody will give me a chance at anything other than an entry-level job because I have a Law degree and "no experience".

I know I can do well if you just give me a chance. I've gotten interview appointments from less than 10% of the job applications I've submitted, but every single time, I have received excellent feedback from my interviewer. Everyone who has supervised me has also said that I have performed far beyond expectations for someone of my level of experience.

Please choose me.
